The group’s excited, everyone likes their character, and yet two sessions in one or more players call it quits. The Premise Document is a tool that helps your group detect and disarm the landmines of “Premise Rejection”, basic misalignments of expectations and desires that can and will derail your game.<p><b>Milestones:</b> Many players struggle with the leap from concept (I’m Batman but with lightning powers) to a complex person with history and needs, the character worthy of being the protagonist of your story. The milestone system helps players craft fully fleshed out characters whose needs tie them tightly to the stakes of your story.</p><p><b>Dramatic Action Scenes:</b> Let’s face it, the least action packed part of most tabletop games is, well… the action. Whether you’re checked out for fifteen minutes waiting for your turn or stopping to calculate the most optimal position to drop your fireball, you might as well be playing a strategy war game for how removed you are from the emotional experience of your character.</p>",

It makes it easy to quickly engage emotionally and build attachments to what's going on. Also, the game is designed to mitigate common difficulties that lead to groups falling apart, like lack of buy-in/commitment/matching expectations. Plus, the action scene resolution where everyone writes their approach simultaneously and reveals together is really cool.",
