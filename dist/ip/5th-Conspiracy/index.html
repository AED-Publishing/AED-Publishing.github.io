The more you’re worshiped, the more powerful you’ll become, even as the precious things that made you human slip away. Balance your need for veneration against the oratum’s number one rule: do not let mankind become aware of your true nature, lest the humans unleash the titan’s wrath back upon the earth, dooming us all.</p><div><div class="nav-wrapper position-relative end-0 pb-4 border-bottom"><ul class="nav nav-pills nav-fill p-1 w-lg-50" role="tablist"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-0 px-0 py-1 active" data-bs-toggle="tab" href="#revolutionary_mechanics" role="tab" aria-controls="revolutionary_mechanics" aria-selected="true">Revolutionary Mechanics</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link mb-0 px-0 py-1 " data-bs-toggle="tab" href="#urban_fantasy" role="tab" aria-controls="urban_fantasy" aria-selected="false">Urban Fantasy</a></li></ul></div><div class="tab-content tab-space"><div class="tab-pane  text-sabon active show" id="revolutionary_mechanics" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="#revolutionary_mechanics"><div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 mb-lg-0 mb-4"><h5 class="mt-5 mb-4">Revolutionary Mechanics</h5><div><p>The 5th Conspiracy system introduces three revolutionary mechanics that strive to resolve some of the most pernicious problems tabletop groups have struggled with since the dawn of gaming; the misaligned expectations that derail your game, creating believable characters that make good protagonists to your story, and action scenes that are as fast paced and exciting to play as for the characters living them.</p><p><b>The Premise Document:</b> Why is it that so many games fall apart after only a few sessions? The group’s excited, everyone likes their character, and yet two sessions in one or more players call it quits. The Premise Document is a tool that helps your group detect and disarm the landmines of “Premise Rejection”, basic misalignments of expectations and desires that can and will derail your game.</p><p><b>Milestones:</b> Many players struggle with the leap from concept (I’m Batman but with lightning powers) to a complex person with history and needs, the character worthy of being the protagonist of your story. The milestone system helps players craft fully fleshed out characters whose needs tie them tightly to the stakes of your story.</p><p><b>Dramatic Action Scenes:</b> Let’s face it, the least action packed part of most tabletop games is, well… the action. Whether you’re checked out for fifteen minutes waiting for your turn or stopping to calculate the most optimal position to drop your fireball, you might as well be playing a strategy war game for how removed you are from the emotional experience of your character.</p></div></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 mb-lg-0 mb-4"><img class="w-100 rounded-3" src="/images/5th Conspiracy Cover with Title - Front Only.jpg" alt="A 5th Conspiracy Picture"/></div></div></div><div class="tab-pane  text-sabon " id="urban_fantasy" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="#urban_fantasy"><div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 mb-lg-0 mb-4"><h5 class="mt-5 mb-4">Urban Fantasy</h5><div>Why were there so many vampire movies in the early 2000s and why are there so many superhero movies these days? Studio trends? No, it’s because the gods kicked the vampires out of Hollywood. Every time you buy your popcorn, silence your phone, and sit reverently while the Avenger’s save the world, you’re secretly saying a prayer and giving some of your precious veneration energy to the gods for whom those characters are a stand-in for.

Why is traffic so bad in Southern California? Because the civil engineers aren’t interested in making an effective transportation network, they’re goal is to maximize the amount of road rage they’re feeding to their wraith overlord. Our world doesn’t make any sense, that is until you understand the perverse incentives its secret masters are driven by. You’re being lied to.</div></div><div class="col-12 col-lg-6 mb-lg-0 mb-4"><img class="w-100 rounded-3" src="/images/witch3final.jpg" alt="A 5th Conspiracy Picture"/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I like using the spectrum of yes. The identities are coll instead of skills. I want to start using a premise document with my group. Really like the needs - esp. situational needs to keep them hooked in.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">Mandy Hall</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">The premise document is a very useful tool, well thought out and has a purpose that is needed. Needs are a fantastic tool, as well.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">Joshua</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">I loved the modern setting and loved supernaturals hiding in plain sight. Mechanics seemed simple and easy to understand. I liked how the premise document set things right up from the start. The action scenes were very story driven, loved it.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">Melissa Bassler</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">The premise document was very helpful - makes implicit assumptions of players + STs explicit. Action scenes moved quickly but also had nuance which is good. Also liked the narrative control players have.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">Mathew Morman</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">I liked the blend of gods | fantasy in modern times.

It makes it easy to quickly engage emotionally and build attachments to what&#x27;s going on. Also, the game is designed to mitigate common difficulties that lead to groups falling apart, like lack of buy-in/commitment/matching expectations. Plus, the action scene resolution where everyone writes their approach simultaneously and reveals together is really cool.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">John-Peter Reiland</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">I really enjoyed the political intrigue between the different supernatural factions. The white board based battles were very interesting. The premise document seems really helpful, although perhaps better for a session 0 then at the beginning of a session 1. I liked the pacing of the action scenes a lot. The character concepts seemed really unique, with lots of room for creativity.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">Matt Dwyer</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">Easy rules, cool setting, good world building, lots of options.

I loved how combat works, makes combat much more fluid. I liked how dramatic beats worked in the game.</p><div class="d-flex align-items-center"><h6 class="mb-0">Gavin Elliott</h6></div></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"><div class="card border shadow-xs mb-4"><div class="card-body text-start p-3 w-100"><p class="mt-4">It is an urban fantasy game with an amazing live action mechanic.
